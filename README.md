The Google Maps project is a collection of user controls that provide a way to interface with Google Earth and (hopefully) embed Google Maps directly into an Arena web page. The current aim of this project is to provide a decent solution for downloading Google KML files that can be loaded into Google Earth. These same KML files can, hopefully, be used later on in an embedded map solution.

See the Wiki for information about this package and the [[Installation]] page for details on installing the modules.
